# DasherG
DasherG is a free terminal emulator for Data General DASHER series character-based terminals.  It is written in [Go](https://golang.org/) using the [Fyne](https://fyne.io) toolkit and should run on all common platforms supported by Go.

## Download
DasherG is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/SMerrony/DasherG).

## Build from Source
### Prerequisites
You will need a working, recent (v1.22 or later) Go compiler.  The first time you build or install
DasherG it might pull in the toolkit dependencies - this will take a little while.  Subsequent
builds should be very quick.

### Build
```go build```

or, if you prefer

```go install```

## Running DasherG
From the build or install directory simply type

```./DasherG```

Optionally, you may add the ```-host=host:port``` argument to connect to a running host via telnet. Eg. 

```./DasherG -host=localhost:23```

For a full list of all available DasherG options type

```./DasherG -h```

### Function and Special Keys
You may have to use the keys simulated on the toolbar in DasherG as your OS might interfere with the physical function keys on your keyboard.  The Shift and Control keys can be used in conjunction with the simulated F-keys just like a real Dasher.

The "Brk" button sends a Command-Break signal to the host when connected via the serial interface.

"Hold" and "Local Print" work as you would expect, although the print actually goes to a user-specified image (PNG) file.

### Bell Sound

For the system bell to operate, DasherG must have been started from a terminal which supports the bell.
